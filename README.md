# Predicting-heart-disease-for-patients

Using Python, I conducted a comprehensive data analysis focusing on predictive modeling for heart disease diagnosis. This involved employing various machine learning algorithms, including random forest, decision tree, and logistic regression. To ensure robust model performance, I meticulously selected pertinent features and optimized model parameters through rigorous GridSearch techniques. By leveraging these methods, I successfully developed predictive models capable of accurately identifying heart disease risk factors in patients, thereby facilitating early diagnosis and intervention strategies.
